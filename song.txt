Another day is over,
another day is done
And now I’m getting closer
to the rising sun

Hey babe, what you doin’?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin’?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Another day is over,
another day is done,
Another night I’m waiting,
waiting for the sun

Hey babe, what you doin’?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin’?
Would you like to sit next to me?
