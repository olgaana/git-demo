Another day is over,
another day is done
And now I’m getting closer
to the rising sun

Hey babe, what you doin’?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin’?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Another day is over,
another day is done,
Another night I’m waiting,
waiting for the sun

Hey babe, what you doin’?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin’?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Well, I don’t know, little lady,
you’re awfully pretty, but I’m a nice man,
I live a nice life, I have a nice house,
I have a great wife
And I’m tired of making decisions
without thinking, oh oh oh

Another moon is shining,
another evening come
Another hour unwinding
’till the night is done

Hey man, what you doin’?
Would you like a little company?
Hey there, how you doin’?
